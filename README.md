# Inferences and Conclusion

The Google Play Store Apps report provides some useful insights regarding the trending of the apps in the play store. As per the graphs visualizations shown above, most of the trending apps (in terms of users' installs) are from the categories like GAME, COMMUNICATION, and TOOL even though the amount of available apps from these categories are twice as much lesser than the category FAMILY. The trending of these apps are most probably due to their nature of being able to entertain or assist the user. Besides, it also shows a good trend where we can see that developers from these categories are focusing on the quality instead of the quantity of the apps.

Other than that, the charts shown above actually implies that most of the apps having good ratings of above 4.0 are mostly confirmed to have high amount of reviews and user installs. There are some spikes in term of size and price but it shouldn't reflect that apps with high rating are mostly big in size and pricy as by looking at the graphs they are most probably are due to some minority. Futhermore, most of the apps that are having high amount of reviews are from the categories of SOCIAL, COMMUNICATION and GAME like Facebook, WhatsApp Messenger, Instagram, Messenger â€“ Text and Video Chat for Free, Clash of Clans etc.

Eventhough apps from the categories like GAME, SOCIAL, COMMUNICATION and TOOL of having the highest amount of installs, rating and reviews are reflecting the current trend of Android users, they are not even appearing as category in the top 5 most expensive apps in the store (which are mostly from FINANCE and LIFESTYLE). As a conclsuion, we learnt that the current trend in the Android market are mostly from these categories which either assisting, communicating or entertaining apps.
